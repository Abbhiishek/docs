# Hyperlinks

Inside a web browser, a document can point to another document using links.

A link is composed by a first part that determines the protocol and the server address, either through a domain name or an IP.

This part is not unique to HTTP, of course.

Then thereâ€™s the document part. Anything appended to the address part represents the document path.

For example, this document address is `https://thevalleyofcode.com/the-web/2-hyperlinks`:

* `https` is the protocol.
* `thevalleyofcode.com` is the domain name that points to my server
* `/the-web/2-hyperlinks` is the document URL relative to the server root path.

The web server is responsible for interpreting the request and, once analyzed, serving the correct response.
