# Lists

We have 2 main kinds of lists: **unordered lists** (the ones you saw in the first example) and **ordered lists**

Unordered lists are created using the `ul` tag. Each item in the list is created with the `li` tag:

```html
<ul>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
</ul>
```

Ordered lists are similar, just made with the `ol` tag:

```html
<ol>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
</ol>
```

The difference between the two is that ordered lists have a number before each item.
