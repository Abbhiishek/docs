# Head Tags

I previously mentioned you can add information to the `head` tag of an HTML document.

The `head` tag contains special tags that define the document properties.

It’s always written before the `body` tag, right after the opening `html` tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  ...
</html>
```

We never use attributes on this tag.

And we don’t write content in it.

It’s just a container for other tags.

Inside it we can have a wide variety of tags, depending on what you need to do:

* `title`
* `script`
* `link`
* `style`
* `meta`

We’ll see them in details in the “More HTML” section.
