# Setting up a React project with Vite

There are many ways to create a project with React.

The way I suggest is by using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Vite is a modern tool that provides a development server, is very fast, and many people in the JS community consider it optimal.

> üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Note: Vite can be used as a replacement for `create-react-app`, another tool that‚Äôs popular but also slower. You can use that instead if you prefer, but I found Vite just great and it can also be used with other libraries, not just React.

To create a project using Vite you first go into the folder where you host all your projects, in my case a `dev` folder in my user‚Äôs home folder.

Then run

```
npm create vite@latest

# or

bun create vite
```

Choose a name for the project. That will also be the project‚Äôs folder name. In this case ‚Äútest‚Äù:

Now you can choose a framework. Pick ‚ÄúReact‚Äù.

Pick JavaScript or TypeScript:

Done!

Now go to the newly created project folder:

```
cd test
```

and run

```
npm install
```

to install the dependencies, followed by

```
npm run dev
```

to start the application:

The application should be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) (the port might be different if it‚Äôs already used)

Now you‚Äôre ready to work on this application!

Here‚Äôs the application folder opened in VS Code.

As you can see, Vite created a basic application and you can now open `src/App.tsx` (TypeScript) or `App.jsx` to start working on it.

</div>

One convenience of a tool like Vite is that now you can add files and Vite will automatically recognize them, without the need of restarting `npm run dev` like we had to do with our Node.js projects.

And when you save a component, it‚Äôs automatically updated in your browser.

It makes development very fast and fun!
