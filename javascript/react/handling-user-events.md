# Handling user events

React provides an easy way to manage events fired from DOM events like clicks, form events and more.

Letâ€™s talk about click events, which are pretty simple to digest.

You can use the `onClick` attribute on any JSX element:

```jsx
<button
  onClick={(event) => {
    /* handle the event */
  }}
>
  Click here
</button>
```

When the element is clicked, the function passed to the `onClick` attribute is fired.

You can also define this function outside of the JSX:

```jsx
const handleClickEvent = (event) => {
  /* handle the event */
}

function App() {
  return <button onClick={handleClickEvent}>Click here</button>
}
```

When the `click` event is fired on the button, React calls the event handler function.

React supports a vast amount of types of events, like `onKeyUp`, `onFocus`,`onChange`, `onMouseDown`, `onSubmit`, and many more.
