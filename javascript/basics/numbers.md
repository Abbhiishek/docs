# Numbers

In JavaScript, you can define numbers without decimal part:

```jsx
const age = 10
const veryBigNumber = 5354576767321
```

or numbers with decimals:

```jsx
const pi = 3.14
const someNum = 0.1234
```

Numbers are a primitive type in JavaScript.

This means they are passed by value, not by reference.

We’ll see what that means.

All numbers have some methods (we’ll see soon what methods are!) including `toString()`, `toFixed()` and some others.
