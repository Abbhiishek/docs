# Built-in objects

JavaScript offers a TON of functionality in what we call “built-in objects”.

In this module I want to offer an overview of them and some examples.

It’s important to note that this is not a complete reference, just an overview.

For more, [refer to MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global\_Objects).
