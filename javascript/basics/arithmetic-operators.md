# Arithmetic operators

In this first introduction to operators, weâ€™ll introduce the operators you are most likely familiar with: arithmetic operators with two operands. Those operators assume the operands are both numbers.

`+` performs an arithmetic sum:

```jsx
 1 + 2 //3
```

Then we have the subtraction operator (-)

```jsx
4 - 2 //2
```

The multiplication operator `*`:

```jsx
4 * 2 //8
```

The division operator `/`:

```jsx
4 / 2 //2
```

And the remainder operator:

```jsx
4 % 2 //0
```
