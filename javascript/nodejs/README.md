# Nodejs

Node.js is a powerful, open-source, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Developed by Ryan Dahl and initially released in 2009, Node.js enables developers to build scalable and efficient web applications. It operates on a single-threaded event-driven architecture, making it capable of handling thousands of concurrent connections without incurring the cost of thread context switching. The platform's non-blocking I/O model optimizes throughput and scalability in applications with many I/O operations, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat systems and live streaming. Node.js has a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools, thanks to its package manager, npm, further enhancing its appeal among developers for building diverse and powerful applications.
